            I spent 20 years in the film industry working with some of the best cinematographers, directors, and producers in the world. Then I lost everything in a divorce and reinvented myself through my second passion: food.
          </p>

          <p>
            What followed was a journey through three restaurant concepts that taught me lessons nobody talks about when you're excited about opening a restaurant. This is about the hard truths that separate the 60% of restaurants that fail in their first year from the ones that actually make it.
          </p>

          <h2>From Film Equipment to Food Service</h2>

          <p>
            I started an independent film equipment rental company that grew into one of the largest owner-operator companies in the world. We had locations in LA, Atlanta, Pittsburgh, and New York. I built a 1,700-item web store selling film equipment internationally. We added two sound stages. I worked with incredible talent and built something I was proud of for two decades.
          </p>

          <p>
            Then I lost it all in a divorce.
          </p>

          <p>
            I could have been bitter. Instead, I decided to follow my second passion - food. I started with a coffee truck serving the film community I knew so well. But a truck needed a home base, so I opened a restaurant. That Italian restaurant needed company, so I added a global BBQ Smokehouse. Then came the sports bar.
          </p>

          <p>
            Three concepts. All different. All eventually closed. Not because the food was bad or the concepts were wrong, but because I learned the hard way that scaling restaurants is completely different from scaling any other business.
          </p>

          <h2>Hard Truth #1: You Can't Be in Three Places at Once</h2>

          <p>
            In the film equipment business, I could scale because equipment either works or it doesn't. Quality control was relatively straightforward. Documentation was clear. Systems were systems.
          </p>

          <p>
            Restaurants are not like that.
          </p>

          <p>
            When I was at the Italian restaurant, the fresh pasta was perfect. The scratch kitchen ran smoothly. Service was impeccable. But then I'd spend time at the Smokehouse, and when I came back to the Italian place, something had shifted. Not catastrophically - just a slow decline that customers noticed before I did.
          </p>

          <p>
            The pasta wasn't quite as good. Service was a little slower. Nothing you could point to and say "That's wrong," but everything was just slightly off. I kept telling myself, "Trust your team. You can't be everywhere."
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>But here's the truth I learned:</strong> You can't trust your team to maintain standards if those standards aren't documented, measured, and monitored systematically. Your best people will try their hardest, but without real systems in place, quality drifts. Always.
          </p>

          <h2>Hard Truth #2: Your Body Will Betray You</h2>

          <p>
            Running three concepts meant 100-hour weeks. Up at 4 AM to prep at the Italian place. Bounce to the Smokehouse for lunch. Check the supplies. Run back for dinner service. Somewhere in there, manage vendors, do payroll, handle complaints, fix equipment, train staff.
          </p>

          <p>
            My back started hurting. I ignored it. Restaurant owners don't have time to be injured, right?
          </p>

          <p>
            Then one day, my back gave out completely. I couldn't stand for more than a few hours. I couldn't lift. I couldn't work the line. I couldn't even walk the floor during service without serious pain.
          </p>

          <p>
            That's when the sports bar started bleeding money. Employees knew I couldn't be there like before. Labor got sloppy. Quality dropped. Problems I would have caught immediately went unnoticed for weeks.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The truth nobody tells you:</strong> If your business requires you to be physically present 80-100 hours a week, you're not building a business - you're building a prison that will eventually destroy your health. Your body will fail before your will does.
          </p>

          <h2>Hard Truth #3: Food Cost is a Moving Target</h2>

          <p>
            The Italian restaurant had incredible food. People raved about it. But I was so focused on food quality that I wasn't watching costs closely enough.
          </p>

          <p>
            I priced my signature dishes based on food costs from months ago. Cheese prices went up 15%. Tomatoes spiked 20%. I didn't adjust menu prices because I didn't want to upset customers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Six months later, I realized my most popular items were barely breaking even. I was selling 50 portions a week of a dish that made almost nothing.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The reality:</strong> Food costs change constantly. Your recipes drift over time. Waste and theft can add 3-5% without you realizing it. Most owners recalculate quarterly at best - which is about three months too late.
          </p>

          <h2>Hard Truth #4: Labor Cost Will Break You Faster Than Food Cost</h2>

          <p>
            Food cost gets all the attention, but labor cost is what kills most restaurants.
          </p>

          <p>
            I thought I could "adjust staffing on the fly." Reality? I was chronically overstaffed during slow periods because I felt guilty sending people home early. I was understaffed during rushes because I didn't want to pay overtime.
          </p>

          <p>
            Overtime crept in slowly. Suddenly I was paying time-and-a-half for 30 hours a week. My best people left because they were exhausted. Then I was stuck training new staff constantly, which cost even more.
          </p>

          <p>
            I was running a 38% labor cost for 18 months. Industry standard is 25-30%. I was bleeding money and didn't realize it because I was too busy to look at the numbers weekly.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The truth:</strong> Labor cost management is not optional - it's survival. You need real-time tracking, optimized schedules based on actual demand, and the discipline to make hard staffing decisions.
          </p>

          <h2>Hard Truth #5: "Trust Your Team" is Code for "I Don't Have Systems"</h2>

          <p>
            When I hurt my back and physically couldn't be at the sports bar every day, things fell apart fast. Not because I had bad people - I had great people. But without me there, standards drifted.
          </p>

          <p>
            Labor costs spiked. Some employees started taking advantage. Inventory disappeared faster. Quality became inconsistent. I didn't see it happening because I didn't have real-time visibility.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Here's what I wish someone had told me:</strong> The restaurants that survive aren't the ones with the best team - they're the ones with the best systems. Document your recipes. Create training manuals. Build checklists. Set up automated ordering. Create systems for inventory, cost tracking, and labor scheduling.
          </p>

          <p>
            Systems beat hustle every single time.
          </p>

          <h2>Hard Truth #6: You'll Work Harder Than Ever and Make Less Money</h2>

          <p>
            In year three, I sat down with an accountant and realized I'd been operating at a 2% net profit margin for two years. After paying myself a barely livable salary, I was working 100 hours a week to make less than I would managing someone else's restaurant.
          </p>

          <p>
            I thought if I had money in the bank, I was profitable. Wrong. Cash flow and profitability are not the same thing. Your busy season might lose money if costs are out of control.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The truth:</strong> Most restaurant owners don't actually know if they're making money. You need to know your numbers in real-time, not at tax time. Prime cost (food + labor) should be 55-60% of sales. If it's higher, you're in trouble.
          </p>

          <h2>What I Learned</h2>

          <p>
            I don't regret the restaurant journey. I learned more in those years than in two decades in film. I met incredible people. I served food that made customers happy. I built something real.
          </p>

          <p>
            But I also learned that passion and hard work aren't enough. You need systems. Real, documented, monitored systems that let the restaurant run without you being there 100 hours a week.
          </p>

          <p>
            I eventually closed all three restaurants. Not because they were failures - the Italian place was actually doing well by then. But because I realized I hadn't built businesses. I'd built expensive jobs that required my constant physical presence.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>That's why OwnerClone exists.</strong> To give independent restaurant owners the systems I didn't have. Real-time food cost tracking. Automated labor management. Multi-location visibility. POS integration that actually works. Systems that let you scale without sacrificing quality or your health.
          </p>

          <h2>The Path Forward</h2>

          <p>
            If I could go back and tell myself one thing before opening that first restaurant, it would be this:
          </p>

          <p className="text-xl font-bold text-primary-600 my-6">
            Treat your restaurant like a data-driven business that happens to serve food, not a food business that happens to need data.
          </p>

          <p>
            The romance of restaurant ownership is real. The passion matters. Food quality matters. Customer experience matters.
          </p>

          <p>
            But none of it matters if you can't pay your bills, if you're working yourself into an early grave, or if you're sacrificing your health and family for a business that's barely profitable.
          </p>

          <p>
            I lost three restaurants learning these lessons. You don't have to.

            <p className="text-gray-700">
              Before restaurants, the OwnerClone founder spent 20 years building one of the largest independent film equipment rental companies in the world, with locations across four major cities and international sales. After losing that business in a divorce, he reinvented himself through his passion for food, starting with a coffee truck and growing to three restaurant concepts. The lessons learned from those years - the systems that were missing, the data that was needed, the visibility that could have saved thousands - became OwnerClone.
